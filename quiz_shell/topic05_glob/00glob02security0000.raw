\begin{note}
Glob expansion happens in the shell,
before the parameters are sent to the program.
This can have unintended security-related side effects.
If you are working in a directory where someone else is allowed to create files,
they can create files that will be expanded by \lstinline{*} into command line arguments.
This problem can be mitigated by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Using \lstinline{./*} instead of \lstinline{*}.
    The former will prepend \lstinline{./} to all filenames,
    and so these files are unlikely to be interpretted as command line arguments.
\item Using \lstinline{--} before any glob operations.
    It is customary for commands to interpret all arguments after \lstinline{--} as filenames,
    and so it is safe to use the glob after \lstinline{--}.
\end{enumerate}
