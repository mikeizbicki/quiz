\begin{note}
For loops are much more common in python (and most other programming languages) because they are easier to reason about.
Everything that a for loop can do, a while loop can also do.
But a while loop can do things that for loops can't (like loop forever).
It is considered good style to use for loops whenever possible.
The hardest part about for loops is understanding the range function,
which is commonly used with for loops.
