\section{Lists}

\begin{note}
A list is the most basic container type in python.
For this quiz, you are responsible for how to read from a list,
but not how to modify a list.
You are responsible for the functions sum, min, and max;
you are also responsible for understanding list slices and list indexing.
\end{note}
