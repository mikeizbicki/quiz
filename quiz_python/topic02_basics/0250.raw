\section{Functions}

\begin{note}
Functions allow you to reuse the same piece of code many times.
A common acronymn for good programming is DRY (don't repeat yourself),
and so functions are used all the time.
Like nested for loops, expected many problems in the future quizzes to involve functions.
\end{note}
