\section{Manipulating Markdown}
\begin{note}
The following problems are designed to get you practice for you markdown compiler assignment.
They contain a combination of correct and incorrect implementations for functions that are needed for that assignment.

Recall that \emph{reading} is generally easier than \emph{writing},
and so I strongly recommend that you work through these functions before beginning the coding of your markdown compiler assignment.
