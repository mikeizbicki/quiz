\begin{note}
Escape codes let us enter hard-to-type characters into strings.
The special character \lstinline{\} (backslash) is used to begin an escape code.
In python, there are four methods of entering ``strings'' that handle escape codes differently:
\begin{enumerate}
\item normal strings \lstinline{'...'}
\item r-strings \lstinline{r'...'}
\item f-strings \lstinline{f'...'}
\item bytes \lstinline{b'...'}
\end{enumerate}
In the problems below, I will only write normal strings for brevity.
But you should be able to solve the problems for any type of string.
