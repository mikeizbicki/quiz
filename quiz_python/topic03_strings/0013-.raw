\begin{note}
Strings are represented internally as binary numbers (i.e. 1s and 0s).
Special conversion tables are used to map these binary numbers into semantically meaningful strings.
The process of going from strings to numbers is called \emph{encoding} and the process of going from numbers to strings is called \emph{decoding}.
You are responsible for understanding:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ASCII encoding/decoding,
\item the difference between \emph{alphabetical} ordering and \emph{ASCIIbetical} ordering, and
\item basic binary/octal/hexadecimal math.
\end{enumerate}
